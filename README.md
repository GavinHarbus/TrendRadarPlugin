# TrendRadar

**Spot emerging trends before they go mainstream.**

TrendRadar is a Chrome extension for content creators. It captures public content signals from Reddit and X as you browse, stores everything locally, and uses AI to surface rising topics and cross-platform momentum.

## How It Works

1. **Browse normally** — TrendRadar runs in the background as you visit Reddit and X
2. **Signals are captured** — post titles, engagement metrics, timestamps, all stored locally on your device
3. **AI analyzes patterns** — choose your preferred provider, use your own API key, and discover what's rising
4. **View trends** — a side panel dashboard shows emerging topics, momentum scores, and cross-platform insights
